for monday i purchased new parts for my project
for tuesday i copied code from the sparkfun website and tinkered with the soil threshold.
for wednesday i tinkered more with the code as it was not working, i found out this was because of two spelling errors and a deleted bracket.
for thursday i had brandon help me with sodering my sensor to its proper cables.
for friday i did the same to the LCD screen but had to resoder it as i messed up on the soder.
