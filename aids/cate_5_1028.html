	<p>What have we accomplished while making a pro webpage?</p>
	<ul>
		<li>We made our webpage on chubbies but with ducks</li>
		<li>We learned more about how to add images into a webpage.</li>
		<li>We got to practice using divs and learned how to use them correctly.</li>
		<li>We learned some new things that helped us, such as z-index and background-image.</li>
		<li>We used gimp a lot, so we learned a lot more on how to use it.</li>
	</ul>
