<h1>How can you even make money off of this? </h1>
<p> you may be asking the question above and i will explain to you in detail how this works. so where to start hmmm well first you need skins wich i will explain later on a diffrent page. but therer basically worth real money, (insert risk here) well now you have your skins and these pro matches are going on all the time 24/7. so to actually bet you just click on the team youd like to win then deposit your skins via steam trade.profit?
