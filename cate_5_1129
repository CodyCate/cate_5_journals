Object Oriented Programming is programming focused around objects which are a bunch of smaller command put together to one.
we use objects because it is easier to control one object other than a multiple lines of code.
it is easier to form larger programs with objects.objects can be copied and pasted and changed at a minimal amount to be reused.it is easier to trouble shoot these objects because they are all centralized.
